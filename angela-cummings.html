overview_markdown: |
  Recognized as one of the foremost fine jewelry designers of our time, Angela Cummings is known for her passion for nature and the three-dimensional art of sculpture. Born in Austria, Ms. Cummings studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti and received a degree as a gemologist, goldsmith and designer from Staaliche Zeichenakademie in Hanau, Germany. After a 17-year partnership with Tiffany & Co., she established her own design company and a presence in some of the most exclusive retail outlets in the world, most notably her eponymous shops at Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.

  Inspired by flora, fauna, and sculpture, Ms. Cummingsâ€™ collection for Assael is museum-quality, featuring a range of motifs and themes. Her exceptional design sensibility is evident in each perfectly balanced detail.
