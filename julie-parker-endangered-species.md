  Julie Parker is a jewelry designer who has worked for esteemed brands such as Hamilton & Inches, Asprey, Elizabeth Gage, Theo Fennell, and Hennell of Bond Street. Her collection for Assael depicts some of the world’s most endangered animal species, and each design may be worn as a pendant or admired as an objet d’art. Incredibly detailed and captivating, the collection includes animals cast in 18K gold, as well as a limited edition series of 5 pieces for each species, set with diamonds and signed & numbered.

  The collection will benefit TUSK, a wildlife conservation group established in response to the poaching crisis in Africa. Tusk’s mission is to find a way to combine the interests of both people and wildlife while preserving Africa’s natural heritage. HRH the Duke of Cambridge became the charity’s Royal Patron and has been an active supporter of Tusk ever since. In 2008, it also became a registered non-profit in the United States, opening TUSK USA in New York. Please visit www.tusk.org to learn more about TUSK.
